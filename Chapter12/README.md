# Chapter 12: Conclusions

I have a theory that web development was designed as a way to share information with family that live far away while giving people something to occupy their time without discovering military secrets. It is included with this textbook on Anatomy and Kinesology because it is only physically possible to exercise from 1-3 hours a day. A common issue with skateboarding is overtraining because of the smaller muscles used in the repetitive movements and long gaps of unemployment with nothing to occupy the remaining 12-14 hours of the day.
