This document is designed as a textbook specifically for kinesiology graduate students seeking to learn more about quantitative methods. It seeks to blend several disciplines into a linear concept: computer science and statistics, anatomy and skateboarding, along with climate and weather.

The chapter number and a brief description is as follows:

  0. Chapter 0: Introduction to Computers
      - Uses Python to introduce how computers work.
      - By the end of the class you should be able to execute code using existing Python libraries like Pandas.
      - todo 0: edit
  1. Chapter 1: CSV Parser
      - Develops a basic version of the CSV parser as seen in the Pandas library.
      - The goal is to learn more about computer science concepts Time and Space complexity.
  2. Chapter 2: Descriptive Statistics
      - Efficiently implement basic descriptive statistics to further an understanding of how computers work.
  3. Chapter 3: Python Graph
      - Create a black and white python graph using no libraries.
  4. Chapter 4: Skateboarding and Anatomy
      - Discusses learning basic skateboarding tricks and the anatomy and physiological functions neccessary to avoid severe bodily injury.
  5. Chapter 5: Geoserver in the Cloud
      - The history of early internet viruses is a hellscape and it might be challenging to understand why these were built. The next few chapters address how they specifically were designed by altruistic programmers focusing on very small problems without understanding the larger picture of how their programs might be misused.
      - Tutorial to install Geoserver on linux and display climate raster timeseries data in a provider such as Google Cloud Platform.
      - The complexities of describing climatology data is challenging. By the time you begin to summarize the information for the layperson all meaning is binned into loaded terms with preconcieved assumptions.
  7. Chapter 6: Linux Automation
      - Describes how to use BASH to install several R and Python libraries to download rasters, transform the data into the format GeoTIFF, and perform calculations.
      - The original data is a raster format called BIL that represents monthly temperature and precipitation data.
      - This is the first two steps of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL).
  8. Chapter 7: GDAL Installation
      - Installs GDAL to build the GeoTIFF rasters in XYZ tile format, which will be hosted on the cloud web server and displayed in the next chapters on web development.
      - It is the Load part of ETL.
  9. Chapter 8: GIS Web Development
      - Uses the JavaScript package manager NPM to install Angular JS and OpenLayers to display the rasters.
  10. Chapter 9: Quantiles
      - Example program that uses Python's Numpy to generate quantiles to more effectively visualize the information.
  11. Chapter 10: AngularJS
      - Builds a timeslider to more effectively view the Nino34 index and the statisical summaries for the raster data.
  12. Conclusions
      - todo

Graduate level students in sociology, psychology, music, or any other discipline that already have a firm understanding of basic programming and mathematics would benefit from learning the material. It might also be interesting for engineering, computer science, or statistics undergraduates to see their material applied to something besides the usual textbook example problem "a train is moving at 50 mph how long does it take to stop without shoes."
