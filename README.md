todo 1: edit the notebooks into markdown (md).

todo 2: Proofread.

This document is designed as a textbook specifically for students seeking to learn more about quantitative methods. It attempts to blend several disciplines into a linear concept: computer science and statistics, anatomy and skateboarding, along with front and backend web development. It is a learning exercise and will not get anyone wealthy but will hopefully provide the tools to avoid self-inflicted irreparable bodily harm.

Graduate level students in Geography or other discipline that already has a firm understanding of basic programming and mathematics would benefit from learning the material. It might also be interesting for engineering, computer science, or statistic students to see material applied to real world problems.

Chapters 0-10 are in a lesson plan structure.

Chapter 11 is a peer-referenced writeup on basic skateboarding.

### Chapter 0: Introduction to Computers
Uses Python to introduce how computers work. By the end of the class you should be able to execute code using existing Python libraries like Pandas.

### Chapter 1 : SciPy and Matplotlib
Todo1: Include a section on using statistical libraries as an intermediate step as a graduate student project.

### Chapter 2: Timeseries Rasters for Geoserver
This course installs Geoserver on Linux to display raster time series data in a local host. The steps are nearly identical to installing the libraries in a cloud provider or web server such as Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services but does not include HTTPS certificate installation.

### Chapter 3: Linux Automation
Describes how to use BASH to install several Python libraries to download rasters and perform calculations.

### Chapter 4: GDAL Installation
Installs GDAL to build the GeoTIFF rasters in XYZ tile format, which will be hosted on a web server and displayed in the next chapters on web development.

### Chapter 5: GIS Web Development
Uses the JavaScript package manager NPM to install OpenLayers to display the XYZ tiles.

### Chapter 6: Quantiles
Example program that uses Python's Numpy to generate quantiles to more effectively visualize numerical summaries.

### Chapter 7: AngularJS
Builds a time slider to more effectively view an index and the statistical summaries for raster data.

### Chapter 8: CSV Parser
Develops a basic version of the CSV parser as seen in the Pandas library to learn more about the computer science concepts Time and Space complexity.

### Chapter 9: Descriptive Statistics
Efficiently implement basic descriptive statistics to further an understanding of how computers work.

### Chapter 10: Python Graph
Create a black and white python graph using no libraries.

### Chapter 11: Skateboarding and Anatomy
Discusses learning basic skateboarding tricks and the anatomy and physiological functions necessary to avoid severe bodily injury.

### Chapter 12: Conclusions
Todo: write.
