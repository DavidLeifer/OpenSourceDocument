## Code Versioning

- ExerciseStatisticsNotebooks: Backups from 2024 while writing the courses. Development of a CSV parser and statistic functions.
- GraphExerciseStatisticsNotebooks: Data visualization graphs. After around 20250401 most of the functions were migrated to an external file 'exercise_module.py' housed in Exercise Modules.
- exercise_modules: Several files including basic imports, usage, and the start of a Cython clone with functions mimicking standard built-in Python such as len(), split(), replace(), and AZ sort().

The notebooks are one cell written in Google Colab similar to executing a .py file with an external library for RGB graphing (Matplotlib).
