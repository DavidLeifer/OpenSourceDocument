### Exercise Modules

- Contains 'exercise_module.py' that is a locally imported file with 'class' functions for parsing CSV or TSV files, column manipulation, and statistics. It was primarily developed on GoogleColab in the ExerciseStatistics.ipynb and GraphExerciseStatistics.ipynb files and in use after around 20250401 when I got tired of scrolling through 1000+ lines.

- 'exercise_module_graphs.py' contains 'def' functions for example usage.

- I also started making default Python functions in 'Cython_clones.py' using C-like syntax (such as len()) and is a good side project for later.
  - I'm guessing that when arrays are created in Python, default functions are included to minimize time and space complexity, for example calculating the length of a list while items are appended or removed.
