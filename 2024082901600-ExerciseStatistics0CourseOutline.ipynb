Description.\n","  Additional information.\n","\n","0. Introduction<br>\n","    - Goal is to develop a CSV parser and while learning about time and space complexities. There are several examples that exist in Python already: pandas, geopandas, csv, etc. This is a learning exercise you won't get rich.\n","    Prerequisites: functional programming i.e. class and def in Python\n","\n","1. Reading Data\n","\n","  **Homework**\n","\n","    Grading Scale:\n","    0. Did not attempt.\n","    1. Read the attached CSV into your choice of python.\n","    2. Use a for loop to print each character.\n","\n","    **Notes**\n","    - Excel Document\n","    - Comma Seperated Values, Tab Seperated Values\n","    - Javascript Object Notation (JSON)\n","      - They are all fancy tables\n","      - Similar to images where numbers represent pixels\n","      - Images have an encoder/decoder to represent data to the computer\n","      - Video driver is written in a lower level programming language to display the information on a screen\n","\n","    Python Options:\n","    - No installation options (Android, iOS, any browser)\n","      - Google Colab <- the course uses this one. The course is written using Jupyter Notebooks. A free gmail account.\n","      - Enroll in Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or other cloud platform. Usually requires a credit card but they would give you a set amount of credits.

Index words and line breaks into a list.

Programming Background\n","\n","  **Week 2 Homework**\n","\n","  **Notes**\n","  - Programming is an abstraction of physical laws and can be summarized by the following list:\n","  1. *Ions* - Group of atoms with an electrical charge\n","    - *cations* - positively charged ions\n","    - *anions* - negatively charged ions\n","    - also *neutral ions*\n","  2. *Electricity* - Ions flow over a material to either turn on or off a lightbulb. Medium material could be you!\n","  3. *Binary* - Ones and zeros that represent instructions to the computer's hardware for electricity to either flow or not flow.\n","  4. *Assembly* - There were several low level languages that were written before displays in the 1940's-1960's. They abstract the complexity of writing binary, making it easier.\n","  5. *C, C++, Python, etc.* - Another language written to abstract binary, removing the tedioum of punching cards as occured in the mid-20th century. Google the original Apollo rocket computer. It was a stack of punch cards 5.5 feet high!\n","\n","  - **Week 2 Homework**\n","\n","4. Time Complexity: Part 1 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 2 Homework**\n","\n","  **Notes**\n","  - *Algorithm* - is a series of instructions to a computer to perform a task.\n","    - Would normally take humans a not-ideal ammount of time to calculate by hand.\n","  - *Time Complexity* - is the amount of time an algorithm takes to perform the set of instructions.\n","\n","  - **Week 2 Homework**\n","\n","5.

Time Complexity: Part 2 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 7 Homework**\n","\n","  - Time complexity: How long an algorithm takes to complete in respect to the size of the input data.\n","  - *Big O Notation* - The graph that describes the decrease in speed an algorithm takes to execute as the input dataset increases.\n","  - Example of short execution time:\n","    - Binary search - finding a value by determining if the value is larger or smaller than the middle value of an array and repeating until finding the value\n","  - Example of long execution time:\n","    - Taveling Sales Problem - Graph theory wherein the user has to visit each node once or more times\n","\n","  - How do you time your code to see how it performs?\n","\n","  `%time`\n","\n","  It is the equivalent of:\n","\n","  ```\n","  def MyFunction(self, data, data_but_cooler):\n","      time_0 = ((datetime.now()).strftime('%H:%M:%S.%f'))\n","\n","      code = code_to_be_executed\n","\n","      time_1 = ((datetime.now()).strftime('%H:%M:%S.%f'))\n","      time_strp_0 = time_0.split(\":\")\n","      time_strp_1 = time_1.split(\":\")\n","      timed = float(time_strp_1[2])-float(time_strp_0[2])\n","      print(timed)\n","\n","      return\n","  ```\n","\n","  Run the function you want timed 1000 times to be sure:\n","\n","  ```B = []\n","  for i in range(1000):\n","      A = MyFunction(data, data_but_cooler)\n","      B.append(A)\n","      print(A)\n","  C = sum(B)\n","  print(C/999)\n","  ```\n","\n","  **Week 7 Homework**\n","\n","9.

Bad time complexity.\n","    2. CSV Column Flipper uses least amount of loops.\n","\n","  **Notes**\n","\n","  - C and C++ are difficult languages to learn without spending a lot of time.\n","  - Python was a hobby project and has morphed into a great learning tool\n","      - The understanding is that you won't become a FAANG Software Engineer knowing basic Python\n","      - Concentrating excessively long periods of time on mathematical concepts in C, C++, and Python syntax can lead to psychosis\n","      - An example in C is datatypes like Float and Double. It might lead someone who hasn't seen their friend in several years to mistake the natural aging process for their friends being replace by government doubles and you have to \"float\" or kill them.\n","    - Python has similar syntactic issues such as over thinking about the term \"self\" in the functional programming.\n","    - This is why a general understanding of mathematics and functional programming is neccessary for the course.\n","  \n","  - By not doing functional programming, the general public can avoid that psychological programming and still learn about photoshop and political misinformation without writing a video driver and risking your health.\n","  - You can learn the open source community might have a great library available for free, but you are downloading malware by installing and pay for use by selling your data.\n","  - Pacing yourself is essential since it's not impressive if you complete the learning in record time and end up hospitalized.\n","\n","11. Time complexity examples\n","\n","12. Time complexity\n","\n","13. Auxillary Space vs Space Complexity\n","  - Auxillary space is the temporary space used by the program to execute an algorithm.\n","  - An example is using temporary variables\n","  -\n","\n","14. space\n","\n","15. aux\n","\n","16. final"],"metadata":{"id":"72Or8tXFdPka"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"JqqQWCzSdPLn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"K85MfaTxdPNq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"wmmeS03QdPP-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
