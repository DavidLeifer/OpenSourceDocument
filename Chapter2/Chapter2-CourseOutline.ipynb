Backup your important files in a few different computers.\n","    \n","      - To use Linux from Windows or MacOS, you can boot from a virtual machine (VM) like Oracle's Virtual Box by downloading both the VM and a Linux OS image from their official websites.\n","\n","      - Examples of Linux OS that are supported financially by private industries and branches of the government include Ubuntu or Debian.\n","\n","    - DO NOT root your phone to install third party commandline applications.\n","\n","    - Another option if you don't have a computer is to sign up for Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform, described here:\n","\n","      - Sign up for 300 Credits with GCP.\n","\n","      - Select “GO TO COMPUTE ENGINE”.\n","\n","      - On “VM Instances” click “Create”. Select your desired Linux distribution.\n","        \n","      - Now you have an instance. Click the SSH button on the right side of the page to bring up the terminal.\n","\n","      - One downside is that you have to have an account with a credit card, which might induce charges if you're not careful.\n","        \n","      - The instance is on the internet and if anyone has the IP address, anyone can view the page's content. Do not use your primary email for this option in case you install a nefarious package.\n","\n","    - The least expensive option long term is to purchase a computer board like RaspberryPi or Adreno, which range in price from $15-70 and has more than enough CPU to learn command line work. Unless you get the 8GB of RAM, these boards have difficulty running video playing websites.\n","\n","  **More Homework Notes: Folder navigation**\n","\n","    - These OS have filesystems that resemble branching tree structures. Below are a list of commands that are used to navigate the text based command line in Ubuntu and can be found on W3 Schools or in the Ubuntu documentation.\n","\n","    ```\n","    Command\t             Description\n","    ls\t                 List the folder (directory) contents of the OS.\n","    cd /path/\t           Change directory.\n","    cd ..\t               Move up one directory.\n","    cp\t                 Copy a file to another directory.\n","    mv file.txt /path/   Move file to another folder.\n","    mkdir\t               Creates a new directory (folder).\n","    rmdir\t               Remove a directory (folder).\n","    exit\t               Closes the Terminal application.\n","    man <command>\t       Shows the manual for a given command.\n","    nano --help          Shows the help page for a command.\n","    ```\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","2. Managing User Permissions\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  - Permission for a file include who in can read, write, or execute a file or directory.\n","  \n","  - Most retail devices connected to the internet can be logged into from other computers using the ssh (secure shell) protocol.\n","\n","    - If someone accesses your computer, they could install a virus or steal other information.\n","\n","    - Some hacking programs on the internet are automated and have no owner, making it impossible for retribution or to stop since the program jumps from device to device similar to the flu virus.\n","\n","  - Hopefully this course will shed light on not falling for automated nonsense.\n","\n","  **Homework Notes**\n","\n","  - Below is not an exhaustive list of permission related commands and includes only the basics.
