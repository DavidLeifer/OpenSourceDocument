Goal is to develop a CSV parser while learning about time and space complexities. There are several libraries that read CSV or other spreadsheet formats that exist in Python: pandas, geopandas, csv, etc. This is a learning exercise you and won't get rich.

Graduate level students in sociology, psychology, music, or any other discipline that already has a firm understanding of basic programming and mathematics would also benefit from learning the material.

Prerequisites: functional programming i.e. know how to write a class and def in Python. Proficient use of tabular libraries such as Pandas.
