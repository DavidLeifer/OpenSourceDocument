Introduction<br>\n","    - Goal is to develop a CSV parser while learning about time and space complexities. There are several libraries that read CSV or other spreadsheet formats that exist in Python: pandas, geopandas, csv, etc. This is a learning exercise you and won't get rich.\n","\n","    - This textbook is for specifically for kinesiology graduate students seeking to learn more about quantitative methods.\n","    \n","    - It might also be interesting for engineering, computer science, and statistics undergraduates.\n","    \n","    - Graduate level students in sociology, psychology, music, or any other discipline that already has a firm understanding of basic programming and mathematics would also benefit from learning the material.\n","\n","    Prerequisites: functional programming i.e. know how to write a class and def in Python.\n","\n","1.

Index words and line breaks into a list.

Programming Background\n","\n","  **Week 2 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  **Notes**\n","  - Programming is an abstraction of physical laws and can be summarized by the following list:\n","  1. *Ions* - Group of atoms with an electrical charge\n","    - *cations* - positively charged ions\n","    - *anions* - negatively charged ions\n","    - also *neutral ions*\n","  2. *Electricity* - Ions flow over a material to either turn on or off a lightbulb. Medium material could be you!\n","  3. *Binary* - Ones and zeros that represent instructions to the computer's hardware for electricity to either flow or not flow.\n","  4. *Assembly* - There were several low level languages that were written before displays in the 1940's-1960's. They abstract the complexity of writing binary, making it easier.\n","  5. *C, C++, Python, etc.* - Another language written to abstract binary, removing the tedioum of punching cards as occured in the mid-20th century.
