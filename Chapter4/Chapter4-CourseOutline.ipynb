Kids from the late 70's through 80's were told that manufacturing jobs were disappearing over seas (haha get it, over C's, it's a computer automation pun) and the only middle class jobs were in computers.\n","        \n","      1. Computer science, business, and Geography colleges told their students to learn software engineering to become more employable.\n","\n","      2. Unemployed Computer Science and Geography graduates would have the ability to program an XYZ sever within 2-5 years.\n","        \n","      3. Most Google and Yahoo searches at that time were to find navigation directions. It would follow that improved data visualization with online mapping software would lead to a large paycheck from IBM or the federal government and an early retirement.\n","\n","    - An accurate analogy for software development in the 1990's is the California Gold rush in the 1800's where the only people that got rich were the merchants selling equipment, who were already wealthy from owning distribution industries.\n","      \n","      - IT was probably a boom for lawyers during the dot com bubble until their jobs were also automated by computers.\n","\n","      - Web masters making discoveries were teenagers and young adults who get intoxicated and forget things like passwords, leading to automated programs buying real estate, concert tickets, and natural resources from websites creating economic bubbles.\n","\n","  **Homework Notes**\n","\n","  - The first step to installing the version of GDAL with the required features is to install the Proj library.\n","\n","    - Chapter 3 introduced the Proj library with the installation of Python methods.\n","    \n","    - Since the Earth is uniquely shaped, various mapping projections were developed to minimize distortion.\n","    \n","    - Since different organizations are geographically located in different areas, they store their data in different projections and the Proj C++ library handles recalculating coordinates.\n","\n","  - Use wget to download proj-X and unzip the package with the command tar or unzip.\n","  \n","    ```\n","      # Install proj-<version>\n","      cd /User/your_download_folder\n","      wget https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-X.X.0.tar.gz\n","      tar xvzf proj-X.X.X.tar.gz\n","    ```\n","\n","  - cd into the directory and configure the project with proj specified as the folder path /usr/local.\n","\n","    ```\n","      cd proj-X.X.X\n","      sudo ./configure --without-curl\n","      sudo make && sudo make install\n","    ```\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","2.
