It creates a new folder called \"dist\" with an index.html and can be viewed on the localhost in a browser.\n","\n","    ```\n","      npm run build\n","    ```\n","\n","  - Copying the contents of the \"dist\" folder onto a Tomcat web server would also display the information.\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","2.

This package was used in the time slider functionality.\n","\n","    ```\n","      # sudo npm install angular\n","    ```\n","\n","  - For whatever reason, npm also required a final npm install at the end to build the application.\n","\n","    ```\n","      sudo npm install\n","    ```\n","\n","  - An interesting side project of the OpenLayer's library is \"ol-ext\" and is not affiliated with OpenLayers but has several additional features.\n","\n","  - It's not used in this tutorial but is worth mentioning because of the extensive API and documentation.\n","\n","    ```\n","      # sudo npm install ol-ext\n","    ```\n","\n","  **Week 3 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","4.
