### Introduction

Goal of this chapter is to learn basic concepts about computers through programming in Python using the Pandas library.

The user should be able to read data, write for loops, and save the information. These skills can be learned from reading the user documentation or any one of the nearly infinite Hello World Python tutorials. If you can do that already, skip to the next chapter.

Prerequisites: Typing on a computer. Navigating a web browser. Not clicking on viruses.
