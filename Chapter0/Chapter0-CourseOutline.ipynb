Introduction\n","\n","    - Goal of this chapter is to learn basic concepts about computers through programming in Python.\n","\n","    - By the end of the chapter, the user should be able to read data, write for loops, and save the information. Pandas and Scipy will be used to perform basic statistical calculations. If you can do that already, skip to the next chapter.\n","\n","    Prerequisites: Typing on a computer. Navigating a web browser. Not clicking on viruses.\n","\n","1. Reading Data: Part 1 of 2\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework: Read data with Pandas**\n","\n","    Grading Scale:\n","    0.

Prints the data.\n","\n","    **Homework Notes**\n","    - The Python library 'Pandas' simplifies reading, performing calculations, and writing data.\n","\n","    - Learning the 'Pandas' library first teaches basic programming concepts that become more complicated without libraries. It will assist in learning the fundamentals for computer science as applied in the next chapters.\n","\n","    - Tables of information include horizontal rows and vertical columns of information.\n","\n","    - The first row or header describes the contents of each vertical column. Example:\n","\n","    ```\n","    ID | Date     | Stamina  <---- This is the header row (0)\n","    0  | 20200410 | 0        <---- This is the first data row (1)\n","    1  | 20200411 | 3        <---- This is the second data row (2)\n","    2  | 20200412 | 2        <---- etc.\n","    3  | 20200413 | 5\n","    ```\n","\n","    - Table formats include:\n","      - Excel Document\n","      - Comma Separated Values, Tab Separated Values\n","      - Javascript Object Notation (JSON)\n","      - They are all tables\n","    - JPGs are similar\n","      - They are fancy tables or matrix of numbers\n","      - Each number represents a pixel value in Red, Green, Blue (RGB)\n","      - Example model ranging from 0-255:\n","        - rgb(127, 173, 187) -> kind of greenish/blue\n","        - Google the term: \"RGB Example\"\n","      - Image formats have an encoder/decoder to represent data as colors to the computer\n","      - Video driver is written in a lower level programming language to display the information on a screen\n","\n","  **More Homework Notes: Python Options:**\n","\n","    - DO NOT root your Phone.

These aren't operated by humans, they're usually automated programs written by unemployed people.\n","\n","    - No installation options (Android, iOS, any browser)\n","      - Google Colab <- the course uses this one.

Electrical engineering complexities are analogous to binary representations.
