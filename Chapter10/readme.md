# Chapter 10

Goal is to learn data visualization techniques by writing a time series graph in black and white text.

There are several examples that exist in Python already: matplotlib, Plotly, seaborn, etc. This is a learning exercise and you won't get rich. Prerequisites: This course builds off previous chapter's on reading input data and performing descriptive statistics.
