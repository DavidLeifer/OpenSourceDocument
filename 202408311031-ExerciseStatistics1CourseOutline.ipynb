Made a mean *and* median function\n","\n","  Vocabulary Review\n","\n","  - *Descriptive Statistics* - summarizing data using quantitative methods.\n","  - *Parametric Statistics* - makes assumptions about the data\n","    - the data is normally distrubted around the mean, or symmetrical like the typical bell curve graph\n","    - at minimum requires 30 data points. Most studies use 100 or more to have good results.\n","      - Do not use significant or confidence to describe the results since those are statistical tests\n","  - *Types of Data*\n","    - *Ordinal* - it is categorical with clear differences in rankings\n","      - the pain scale CSV that I made up for this class is an example\n","    - *Nominal* - there is no order between the value\n","      - W3 Schools Python example: blonde, brunette, etc.\n","    - *Interval* - or numerical data that is equally spaced integers\n","      - for example income values: $500, $1000, $1500, etc.\n","      - calories and alcohol columns in B0.csv are examples\n","        - calories are the actual measureable amount of food energy consumed\n","        - alcohol is the number of alcohol servings consumed\n","  - There are several statistical errors treating ordinal data as if it were parametric since they aren't real world measurements\n","  - The mean is typically used in parametric statistics\n","  - The median is typically used in non-paramteric statistics\n","  - More information:\n","  https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/\n","\n","  **Week1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","2. Descriptive Statistics Vocabulary Part 2 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  Parametric Vocabulary Review\n","\n","  - *Mean* - Greek letter mu - the sum of all numbers divided by the count of values. Used in parametric statistics.\n","\n","  - *Median* - the middle most number of the dataset and is typically used in non-paramteric statistics\n","\n","  - *Standard deviation* - each value in the dataset minus the mean. That number is then squared. Then sum each of those numbers and divide by the count of numbers. The square root of that number is then the standard deviation.\n","\n","    - Represented by the Greek lower case letter for sigma.\n","\n","    - Also the second central moment of the distribution.\n","    \n","      - A statistician can calculate the skewness and kurtosis which represent the third and forth moment.\n","\n","      - An obssesive staistician can calculate 7 or more moments but they are more influenced by the outliers.\n","\n","    - It is interesting that the Google Sheets functions for mean, count, and standard deviation return different values than the Python implementation. There are two possible causes:\n","      1. Python is using feature reduction to reduce hardware use on repetitive numbers, as examined in the previous class.\n","      2. Asymptotic theory with infinite vs finite data samples\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","3. Time complexity\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  Week 1 Homework: Time complexity explanation.\n","\n","    - Harken back to Week 7 of the previous semester where time complexity was discussed. The statistics program that is being written should be as efficient as possible, meaning it takes the least amount of time to execute in respect to Big O Notation.\n","\n","    - Now that statistics functions are being applied to the CSV, it makes more sense to have each column as a vertically organized list, rather than horizontally for two reasons:\n","      - It uses the least amount of loops\n","      - The code is more readable\n","    \n","    - That means you have to rewrite the *csv_flipper* function and loop through the lists while using the class and functions.\n","\n","        **Summary of improved code:**\n","\n","        0. Flipping the columns from high to low for readability\n","\n","        1. If the original value was 5, set it to equal 0 (no pain)\n","\n","        2. If the original value was 0, set it to equal to 5 (high pain) etc.\n","\n","        3. If none of those things are true, append the string (for the column header)\n","\n","        ```\n","        def csv_flipper(self, csv_list, col_width):\n","          csv_flipped = []\n","          for i in csv_list:\n","            if i == str(5):\n","              n = str(1)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(4):\n","              n = str(2)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(3):\n","              n = str(3)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(2):\n","              n = str(4)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(1):\n","              n = str(5)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            else:\n","              csv_flipped.append(i)\n","          return csv_flipped\n","        ```\n","        Example answers for Time Complexity:\n","\n","        - The first two methods are worse because not only does it take up more space in memory, it also navigates the list twice making the program slower.\n","\n","        - It does this by first organizing the data vertically instead of horizontally. Efficiency gains are seen further in the next class on statsitics.\n","        \n","        - It doesn't really matter for lists with 22 columns and 32 rows or several hundred strings but would take too long and cost too much money spent on server storage to use inefficient functions. Back in the day, RAM and storage were measured in kilobytes.\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","4.

Function to calculate the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.\n","  \n","  It should be clear that before computers became widespread, these types of calculations would take 10 years to complete by hand and you would earn a PhD and a post-doctorate. The student would be distracted enough during their 20's to not get belligerently intoxicated, destroy property, and burn down the house while passing on complicated mathematical information that takes several hundred years to acquire.\n","  \n","  The goal is to not lose the critical thinking skills between genertaions. Loss of knowledge is best captured by the time between the Greek and Roman empires or etween the Arabic empire at the first millennium and European artistic rennaisance in the 17th and 18th centuries during the dark ages in Europe. Causes were usually due to famine and the ensuing fight for scarce resources and justified by bastardized interpretations of religious texts. Heightened mathematical thinking is evidenced in the Greek and Roman empire infrastructure consisting of enough surplus goods and services to construct drained roads and aqueducts for irrigation. The Arabic empires discovered algebra and constructed complex cities before collapsing. The Western Europe period of enlightenment popularized similar thinking.\n","\n","  **Central Moment Vocabulary**\n","\n","  Recall that variance or standard deviation is the second central moment of a probablility distribution and is represented by lower case sigma.\n","\n","  - Skewness - is the third central moment. There are several version of this equation. The one we will use is defined here: subtracts each value in the list by the overall mean and multiplies itself three times or to the third power. The sum of that number is then calcualted. The sum is divided by the count of values in the list. That number is divided by the standard deviation to the power of 3 (or cubed).\n","\n","    - The equation is for the entire population of the data or all the numbers.\n","\n","    - In contrast to a sample of the dataset, which subtracts 1 from the count (N-1) before the first division.\n","\n","    - There was a long argument about whether skewness measures peakedness or flatness of the bell curve and can be read in full on the NIH here:\n","\n","      - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321753/\n","\n","    - The equation is defined as such by the NIST and in the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science (PDF download from the University of Texas):\n","\n","        - https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm\n","\n","        - https://lbj.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/file/news/Skew.pdf\n","\n","  - Kurtosis - UCLA provides definition for three kurtosis equations:\n","\n","    - Two sums of powered deviation scores, which are used later:\n","\n","      - s2 = (xi - mu) ^ 2\n","\n","      - s4 = (xi - mu) ^ 4\n","\n","    - Calculate the standard deviation:\n","\n","      -  m2 = s2/n\n","\n","      -  m4 = s4/n\n","\n","    - Above and beyond unbiased estimate\n","\n","      - V(x) = s2/n-1\n","\n","    - The first defintion of kurtosis used by SAS summarize function and cites a textbook:\n","\n","      - kurtosis = (m4/m2^2) - 3\n","\n","      - Snedecor, G.W. and Cochran, W.G.
