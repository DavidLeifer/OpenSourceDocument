Description.\n","  Additional information.\n","\n","0. Introduction<br>\n","    - Goal is to learn descriptive statistics and implement them in Python using functions\n","    - There are several examples that exist in Python already: sci-py, numpy, etc. This is a learning exercise and you won't get rich.\n","    Prerequisites: Exercise Statistics 0. This course builds directly off the previous work. At least some memory of statistics.\n","\n","1. Descriptive Statistics Vocabulary Part 1 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework: Mean and Median**\n","\n","    - Make a new class 'Statistics' and two functions. One to calculate the mean and one to calculate the mode.\n","\n","    Grading Scale:\n","    0. Did not attempt\n","    1. Made a mean *or* median function\n","    2. Made a mean *and* median function\n","\n","  Vocabulary Review\n","\n","  - *Descriptive Statistics* - summarizing data using quantitative methods.\n","  - *Parametric Statistics* - makes assumptions about the data\n","    - the data is normally distrubted around the mean, or symmetrical like the typical bell curve graph\n","    - at minimum requires 30 data points. Most studies use 100 or more to have good results.\n","      - Do not use significant or confidence to describe the results since those are statistical tests\n","  - *Types of Data**\n","    - *Ordinal* - it is categorical with clear differences in rankings\n","      - the pain scale CSV that I made up for this class is an example\n","    - *Nominal* - there is no order between the value\n","      - W3 Schools Python example: blonde, brunette, etc.\n","    - *Interval* - or numerical data that is equally spaced integers\n","      - for example income values: $500, $1000, $1500, etc.\n","      - calories and alcohol columns in B0.csv are examples\n","        - calories are the actual measureable amount of food energy consumed\n","        - alcohol is the number of alcohol servings consumed\n","  - There are several statistical errors treating ordinal data as if it were parametric since they aren't real world measurements\n","  - The mean is typically used in parametric statistics\n","  - The median is typically used in non-paramteric statistics\n","  - More information:\n","  https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/\n","\n","  **Week1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","2. Descriptive Statistics Vocabulary Part 2 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  Parametric Vocabulary Review\n","\n","  - *Mean* - Greek letter mu - the sum of all numbers divided by the count of values\n","\n","  - *Standard deviation* - each value in the dataset minus the mean. That number is then squared. Then sum each of those numbers and divide by the count of numbers. The square root of that number is then the standard deviation.\n","\n","    - Represented by the Greek lower case letter for sigma.\n","\n","    - Also the second central moment of the distribution.\n","    \n","      - A statistician can calculate the skewness and kurtosis which represent the third and forth moment.\n","\n","      - An obssesive staistician can calculate 7 or more moments but they are more influenced by the outliers.\n","\n","    - It is interesting that the Google Sheets functions for mean, count, and standard deviation return different values than the Python implementation. There are two possible causes:\n","      1. Python is using feature reduction to reduce hardware use on repetitive numbers, as examined in the previous class.\n","      2. Asymptotic theory with infinite vs finite data samples\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","3. Time complexity\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Due**\n","\n","  Week 1 Time complexity explanation.\n","\n","    - Harken back to Week 7 of the previous semester where time complexity was discussed. The statistics program that is being written should be as efficient as possible, meaning it takes the least amount of time to execute in respect to Big O Notation.\n","\n","    - Now that statistics functions are being applied to the CSV, it makes more sense to have each column as a vertically organized list, rather than horizontally for two reasons:\n","      - It uses the least amount of loops\n","      - The code is far more readable\n","    \n","    - That means you have to rewrite the *csv_flipper* function and loop through the lists while using the class and functions.\n","\n","        - Example of improved code:\n","        Flipping the columns from high to low for readability\n","        If the original value was 5, set it to equal 0 (no pain)\n","        If the original value was 0, set it to equal to 5 (high pain) etc.\n","        If none of those things are true, append the string (for the column header)\n","\n","        ```\n","        def csv_flipper(self, csv_list, col_width):\n","          csv_flipped = []\n","          for i in csv_list:\n","            if i == str(5):\n","              n = str(1)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(4):\n","              n = str(2)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(3):\n","              n = str(3)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(2):\n","              n = str(4)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            elif i == str(1):\n","              n = str(5)\n","              csv_flipped.append(n)\n","            else:\n","              csv_flipped.append(i)\n","          return csv_flipped\n","        ```\n","        Example answers for Time Complexity:\n","\n","        - The first two methods are worse because not only does it take up more space in memory, it also navigates the list twice making the program slower.\n","          - It does this by first organizing the data vertically instead of horizontally. Efficiency gains are seen further in the next class on statsitics.\n","        \n","        - It doesn't really matter for lists with 22 columns and 32 rows or several hundred strings but would take too long and cost too much money spent on server storage. Back in the day, 2 kilobytes was a lot of memory.\n","\n","4.
