Installed Apache Server\n","\n","  **Notes**\n","\n","    - Apache Server is an open source web server.\n","\n","    - It is a default server when starting a Google Cloud Platform instance with Debian or Ubuntu instance, meaning if you were to follow these steps on a cloud provider, the information would be available at the instances IP address.\n","\n","    - This course will continue using a Linux image in a Virtual Box and displaying the web development information on the local machine.\n","\n","    - Enter the command to update Linux and install apache2. The -y flag automatically tells the the utility apt to bypass the yes question.\n","\n","      ```\n","        sudo apt update\n","        sudo apt install apache2 -y\n","      ```\n","\n","    - Optional: This step is not required for local host but would allow the installation of HTTPS certificates in a production environment.\n","\n","      ```\n","        sudo a2ensite default-ssl\n","        sudo a2enmod ssl\n","      ```\n","\n","    - Pointing a web browser to localhost would reveal a basic text page.

Downloaded data and created the directory(s).\n","\n","  **Notes**\n","\n","  - The open source Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) library provides several Python, C++, and command line tools that are similar to ESRI functions.\n","\n","  - One such tool converts geoTIFFS to XYZ files.\n","\n","  - This tool will be installed in the next chapter but there are several data management steps neccesary for to write the automated BASH file.\n","\n","  - The idea is to eventually have all the data and Python files in one location and referenced in a .sh file that will be run when the user is in the directory.\n","\n","  **Homework Notes**\n","\n","  - The first step is to download timeseries rasters from your source with wget, similar to the previous chapter. One place to acquire geoTIFFS is the USGS Earth Explorer.\n","\n","    ```\n","      sudo apt install wget\n","      wget <https_path_to_your_downloads>\n","    ```\n","\n","  - The command line tool mkdir creates several folders on the web server to store the output XYZ files from the GDAL commands.\n","  \n","  - In a production environment, you would use a Database for increased security and features but since the data is already available on the internet it can be used to learn the technology of how to display tiles.\n","\n","    ```\n","      # Make directory(s) to hold the xyz tiles\n","      sudo mkdir /var/www/html/<title_of_your_data>/\n","    ```\n","\n","  **Week 2 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","3.
