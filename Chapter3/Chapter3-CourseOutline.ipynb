Description.\n","  Additional information.\n","\n","0. Introduction<br>\n","    - Goal is to learn data visualization techniques by writing a time series graph in text.\n","    - There are several examples that exist in Python already: matplotlib, Plotly, seaborn, etc. This is a learning exercise and you won't get rich.\n","    Prerequisites: This course builds off previous chapter's on reading input data and performing descriptive statistics.\n","\n","1. Highest and Lowest Number Part 1 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework: Highest and Lowest**\n","\n","    - Make a new class 'Graph' and a function 'hi_lo' that returns the highest number and lowest number from a list of numbers.\n","\n","    Grading Scale:\n","    0. Did not attempt\n","    1. Function calculates the highest number\n","    2. Function calculates the highest and the lowest number\n","\n","  - Finding the lowest and highest number is a basic algorithm that can be accomplished in a time complexity of O(n) and auxiliary space O(1).\n","\n","  - One method is to sort the list and return the first and last value of the list. Time complexity is O(n log n).\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","2. Highest and Lowest Number Part 2 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  - Another method is linear search, which sets the high and low number and replaces the values by comparison in a loop. Time complexity is 0(n).\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","3. Highest and Lowest Number Part 3 of 3\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","  - Other methods include the tournament selection approach which divides the dataset into two parts but increases auxiliary space to O(log n).\n","  \n","  - Pairwise comparison is the same speed and space as linear search.\n","\n","  **Week 1 Homework Reminder**\n","\n","4.
